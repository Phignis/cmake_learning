Repository for CMake learning tutorials

This repository aims to learn CMake in more depth rathen than just on-the-go knowledge I may have acquire with already existing CMake pipelines I have worked with during internships and work. Therefore, this repository aims to have strong basis on CMake, and act as proof of knowledge and practice for future experiences.
